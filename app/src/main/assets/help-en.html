    <h2>Unable to authorise or failed?</h2>
    <p>Clicking on authorisation on the authorisation page will take you to the system browser to start the Notion authorisation process.
        However, some models may block the link by default, so you can manually copy the last callback address and then go back to the App's authorisation page and paste the link by clicking on the Icon in the top right corner.</p>
    <p>If you are prompted with an authorisation failure after getting the callback link, it is possible that the authorisation Token has timed out and you can re-initiate the authorisation.</p>

    <h2>Page content not ordered correctly?</h2>
    <p>As the Notion Api does not offer sorting-related operations, we can only add content to the end of the article. However, as each content block contains a modification time, the App will sort by this time.</p>
